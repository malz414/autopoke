           <h1><strong>The Definitive Guide to Pokemon Unite Autochess by SilentSheepy</strong></h1><p>(Last Updated: May 6, 2025)</p><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed.png"><p>note: I spent like 50 hours writing this guide (by hand, without using AI) so please do not steal any of its contents without permission first. If you want to use any part of this guide just ask me and I will say yes.</p><h1><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h1><p>Hi, I‚Äôm SilentSheepy and this is an in-depth guide on Pokemon Unite autochess. Whether you're new to the game or a seasoned veteran, I‚Äôm confident that reading this guide will improve your autochess skills and help you climb the ranked ladder. </p><p>I currently play on the Chinese ladder (as the game is not released for global yet) and am ranked 32 on the leaderboard with a 15k+ elo rating. Here is my profile/stats:</p><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed+1.png"><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed+2.png"><strong></strong><p>This guide starts off targeted towards beginners but also goes into intermediate/advanced tactics. If you are already familiar with the game, you can jump to the more advanced sections later on in the guide. Otherwise, let's begin with the fundamental basics of the game!</p><h1><strong><u>1. The Fundamental Basics</u></strong></h1><p>Pokemon Unite autochess is an <strong>‚Äòautobattler‚Äô</strong> game, meaning that you build teams which automatically fight for you in a series of rounds. You cannot directly control the fighting- which means that your success depends on how you prepare your team beforehand. </p><h2><strong>Core Gameplay</strong></h2><p>Each round generally follows the same loop:</p><ol><li>Buy units from the shop.</li><li>Place units from your bench to the battlefield (or vice-versa).</li><li>Position units strategically.</li><li>Sit back and relax while you watch your team auto-battle against another player or NPC.</li><li>Win and deal damage to opponents‚Äô HP or lose and take damage to your own HP.</li><li>Repeat each round until only 1 player remains.</li></ol><h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2><p>There are 2 main resources in the game: <strong>Gold</strong> and <strong>Experience (XP).</strong></p><p><strong>Gold</strong></p><ul><li>Used to buy units, refresh (re-roll) the shop, and level up.</li><li>You gain gold after every round or by selling units.</li><li>Gold management is important in autobattler games because you need to balance <strong>spending vs. saving</strong> (see economy section later on).</li></ul><p><strong>Experience (XP)</strong></p><ul><li>Used to level up, which grants various rewards such as an <strong>increased board size</strong> (how many units you can field) or <strong>Unite Discs</strong> (which grant 2‚òÖ Pokemon their unite move).</li><li>You gain 4XP after every round. </li><li>As your level increases, so will your % chance of finding higher rarity Pokemon in the shop.</li></ul><h2><strong>Units and Synergies</strong></h2><p>Every Pokemon has their own <strong>cost</strong> (between 1-5 gold) and <strong>traits</strong> (water, fire, dark, burst, etc.). </p><p>All Pokemon purchased from the shop come at a 1‚òÖ level. When you collect <strong>3 copies</strong> of the same Pokemon, that unit will automatically <strong>level-up.</strong></p><ul><li>For example, collecting 3x copies of a 1‚òÖ Pikachu will turn it into a 2‚òÖ Pikachu.</li></ul><p>When you have 2 or more different Pokemon with the same traits on the board, <strong>synergy bonuses</strong> will activite. Synergy bonuses can be activated from either Pokemon types (water, fire, dark, etc.) or Pokemon classes (burst, universal, etc.).</p><h2><strong>Board and Bench</strong></h2><p>The battlefield, also known as the board, is where fighting takes place to determine the winner of the round. The bench contains your reserve Pokemon which do not actively participate in the fight.</p><p>When you purchase a unit from the shop, that unit will sit on your bench. Your bench holds up to 8 units. If your bench is full, you must place a unit onto the battlefield (board) or sell a unit to make space.</p><h2><strong>Rounds</strong></h2><p>Round 1 is fully hands-off, meaning that you begin with a random 1-cost starter Pokemon. After this round, you will have the option of choosing between 3 randomly selected Pokemon of 1 or 2-cost. </p><p>On round 3 and every 3 rounds afterwards, you will receive an item. </p><p>On rounds 6, 12, and 18, you will fight against a wild Pokemon instead of another player.</p><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed+3.png"><h1><strong><u>2. Key Concepts</u></strong></h1><h2><strong>Economyü™ô</strong></h2><p>Managing your gold (economy) involves strategically balancing spending vs. saving. Spending gold means making your short-term position stronger via purchasing units, levelling up units, refreshing the shop, or levelling up. Spending gold strengthens your long-term position as it allows you to receive interest and saves money to purchase higher rarity units later on. </p><p>In Pokemon Unite, you receive additional <strong>interest</strong> after every round of <strong>+1 gold for every 10 you have saved</strong> in your bank, up to a maximum of +3 gold for 30 saved.</p><p>All players passively gain an amount of gold after each round, which differs based on the current round number. On rounds heading into a wild Pokemon battle (after round 5, 11, and 17), players receive more passive gold than usual. </p><p>You can also gain up to +3 gold per round based on your current <strong>win/lose streak</strong> (see below).</p><h2><strong>Win/Lose Streaksüî•</strong></h2><p>Winning or losing rounds versus other players in a row will contribute to your current win/lose streak and grants additional gold after every round based on the following:</p><ul><li>2 win/lose streak: +1 gold</li><li>3-4 win/lose streak: +2 gold</li><li>5+ win/lose streak: +3 gold</li></ul><p>Streaks are not affected by wild Pokemon rounds (round 6, 12, and 18). This means that whenever possible, you should try to head into wild Pokemon rounds with a win or lose streak already established so that you can receive more bonus gold for that round.</p><p>Win/lose streaks are key for building your economy, so it is recommended to try and keep your streak for as long as possible, especially in the early game. </p><h2><strong>Health Management‚ù§Ô∏è</strong></h2><p>Every player starts with 50HP and cannot gain more throughout the game. Dropping to 0HP means that a player has been defeated and knocked out of the game.</p><p>Players take damage to their HP based on a combination of the level of the opposing player and the number of opposing Pokemon still alive on the board when they lose a round. This means that in general, players take less HP damage in the early game and more in the late game.</p><p>HP is not very important in the early game, but becomes much more important later on. In the early game, you can sacrifice HP to build your economy via saving gold for interest and lose streaking. </p><p>If your HP is running low, you should consider spending gold to make your board stronger via levelling or re-rolling for units in the shop. </p><h2><strong>Power Spikesüí•</strong></h2><p>A power spike is a sudden increase in the strength of a board. This usually happens through a combination of 1 or more of the following events:</p><ul><li>Reaching the next level</li><li>Buying a Pokemon you needed for synergy</li><li>Buying a strong Pokemon</li><li>Levelling up a unit to a 2‚òÖ or 3‚òÖ copy of itself</li><li>Equipping an item</li><li>Spending gold to re-roll for needed units</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>Power spikes are helpful for a variety of situations from winning against your next opponent, continuing your win streak, stabilizing your HP after losing, or reversing your lose streak. </p><p>Common levels for power spikes are explained later on under advanced tips - playing on a curve.</p><h2><strong>When to RollüîÅ</strong></h2><p>The main question you need to ask yourself before re-rolling is <strong>‚Äúwhat am I trying to accomplish by re-rolling‚Äù</strong>? If you don‚Äôt know the answer, you probably don‚Äôt need to re-roll. </p><p>When you spend gold to roll, you should have a target outcome in mind. Are you trying to find a unit that you need? Hit a 2‚òÖ copy of a Pokemon? How much gold are you ok with spending?</p><p>Re-rolling is usually better when you already have 2 copies of a Pokemon (or multiple Pokemon) on your board/bench so you only need to find 1 more copy of it in the store for it to ‚òÖup. </p><h2><strong>When to Level‚¨ÜÔ∏è</strong></h2><p>Similarly to re-rolling, you should ask yourself <strong>‚Äúwhat do I get by leveling?‚Äù</strong> to decide whether or not to do it. </p><p>Unlike re-rolling, leveling gives you a guaranteed boost in the strength of your board. Leveling also gives you access to higher rarity Pokemon which you may need to build your team comp or hit a power spike.</p><p>The simplest way to play is to invest all of your excess gold above 30 (the maximum interest threshold) towards levels. However, there will be times where you may be ok with dropping below 30 gold to reach the next level. Common situations where you would want to level include:</p><ul><li>You have a strong Pokemon on the bench and need an extra board slot to use it.</li><li>You want to equalize the # of Pokemon on the board versus your opponent or gain an advantage.</li><li>You plan on re-rolling right afterwards to look for a higher rarity Pokemon.</li><li>You want an Unite Disc</li><li>etc.</li></ul><h2><strong>Rolling/Levelling Patternsüìà</strong></h2><p>Each level comes with its own set of probabilities for the rarity of Pokemon you will see in the shop. Thus, there are a few playstyle patterns which emerge:</p><p><strong>Standard</strong></p><ul><li>Only re-roll when needed, accumulate interest if possible and invest extra income into levels. </li><li>Most players will utilize this playstyle as it is considered safe and flexible.</li><li>Works with basically every team comp.</li></ul><p><strong>Slow Rolling</strong></p><ul><li>Stay at level 5 for longer than normal and re-roll extra income to find a fast 3‚òÖ copy of a 1 or 2-cost Pokemon.</li><li>Good for winstreaking in the early game.</li><li>Works well with comps such as fire where you can find a 3‚òÖ Charizard, Cinderace, or Delphox.</li></ul><p><strong>Fast 7</strong></p><ul><li>Minimize re-rolling, invest all money into hitting the next level (and ideally level 7) as fast as possible. </li><li>Allows you to grab higher rarity Pokemon before others do.</li><li>Often risky, but allows you to jump towards the late game and focus on building higher rarity Pokemon. </li></ul><h2><strong>Move SelectionüåÄ</strong></h2><p>Upon reaching 2‚òÖ, every Pokemon will have a second move that they can choose from. </p><p>Pokemon can only use <strong>1 move at a time</strong>, and you can <strong>swap moves only once each round</strong>. </p><p>Depending on the Pokemon, one move should almost always be played over the other. Otherwise, the best move is usually situational. For example, if your Charmelon is damage-focused then flamethrower is better but if you are using Charmelon as a tank, fire punch is preferred.</p><p>For my recommended movesets for each Pokemon, refer to the image below:</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVgOAfm0epmJsI__PYq2vi4P59hsps_n7MaTIBGp-XQ/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed+4.png"></a><h2><strong>Ultimate Move Discüíø</strong></h2><p>Equipping a 2‚òÖ Pokemon with an Unite Disc allows that Pokemon to use their ultimate move (ult) during battle. Ultimate moves are activated by either auto-attacking a number of times or after a set duration of time.</p><p>You receive your first Unite Disc upon reaching level 5 and receive a second Unite Disc at level 8 (max level).</p><p>Unite Discs make the Pokemon they are attached to incredibly stronger, so it is important to choose which Pokemon you want to have ult on. Some ults are much stronger than others when compared against other units of the same cost (e.g., Cramorant, Umbreon, Urshifu, Tyranitar, etc.</p><h2><strong>Itemsüéí</strong></h2><p>Every 3 rounds, you will have a choice between 3 items which can be equipped to your Pokemon. <strong>Up to 2 items can be attached</strong> to each Pokemon which will make them stronger through stat increases, special effects, or both. </p><p>On rounds <strong>6, 12, and 18,</strong> you may find an <strong>emblem</strong> that corresponds to a particular Pokemon type. Emblems grant +1 to that synergy and can only be attached to Pokemon of the same type.</p><p>On rounds <strong>outside of 6, 12, and 18</strong>, you will not find any emblems but gain the option to re-roll your item options once.</p><p>During the preparation phase before a round starts, you can freely move items between your Pokemon as often as you‚Äôd like. You can also attach items to Pokemon after a round has begun. </p><p>In general, <strong>defensive items are best suited for tanks</strong> and <strong>offensive items are best suited for damage dealers.</strong> Item flexibility is also important so that you can shift items around as the game progresses. Defensive items are mostly similar, while offensive items can be split into attack speed/attack damage for physical attackers and special attack/move damage for special attackers.</p><p>For my recommended items for each Pokemon, refer to the image below:</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fVgOAfm0epmJsI__PYq2vi4P59hsps_n7MaTIBGp-XQ/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/media/pokemon/unnamed+5.png"></a><h2><strong>Synergiesüîó</strong></h2><p>Synergies come in 2 direct forms: <strong>type</strong> and <strong>class.</strong> Synergies become stronger with more Pokemon having that trait on the board.</p><p><strong>Type Synergy</strong></p><ul><li>Each Pokemon has 1 or 2 types (fairy, psychic, etc.).</li><li>Type synergies grant bonus stats or special abilities/effects when active on the board.</li><li>Emblems can be used to add an additional synergy level for that emblem type.</li></ul><p><strong>Class Synergy</strong></p><ul><li>Each Pokemon has 1 class (skilled, support, etc.).</li><li>Class synergies grant a specific bonus stat to Pokemon that have the synergy active.</li></ul><p><strong>Indirect synergies</strong> result from Pokemon which do not have innate benefits from being on the board with another Pokemon, but are strong when paired together. For example, a Clefable may not have any direct synergies with a Tyranitar but the indirect synergy provided by Clefable‚Äôs healing boosts Tyranitar‚Äôs power tremendously. </p><h2><strong>Pokemon Compositionsüß©</strong></h2><p>The standard team consists of a <strong>front line</strong> and a <strong>back line</strong>. Front line units are generally melee and absorb incoming damage from the enemy team. Back line units are ranged and focus on dealing damage. </p><p>Front line units generally consist of <strong>tanks, fighters, and/or supports</strong>. Back line units generally consist of <strong>auto-attackers</strong> and <strong>mages</strong>. Here is a short description of each role:</p><ul><li><strong>Tank:</strong> Draws attacks from opposing Pokemon and soaks damage. Usually stays alive via damage reduction, shields, or healing. <ul><li>Examples: Crustle, Umbreon, Lapras, Snorlax.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fighter:</strong> Has a balance between tankiness and damage.<ul><li>Examples: Charizard, Lucario, Urshifu, Tyranitar.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Support:</strong> Focuses on providing utility, shielding, and/or healing for teammates.<ul><li>Examples: Wigglytuff, Eldegoss, Clefable</li></ul></li><li><strong>Auto-attacker:</strong> Relies on attack speed and attack stat to put out consistent damage.<ul><li>Examples: Decidueye, Cinderace, Glaceon</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mage:</strong> Relies on moves and special attack stat to deal burst damage.<ul><li>Examples: Pikachu, Delphox, Espeon, Gengar</li></ul></li></ul><p>A balance between strengthening your front line versus your back line is key. If your front line units die too fast, your back line becomes vulnerable. On the other hand, you will not be able to deal enough damage if your back line units are weak. </p><p>Some Pokemon and compositions will naturally counter others. Back line snipers (like Inteleon) are fantastic against enemy teams which rely on long-ranged characters to do damage but are weak against front-line focused teams which use fighters as their carries. </p><h2><strong>Scoutingüîç</strong></h2><p>Scouting is probably one of the most important concepts to learn for autochess games. Scouting refers to <strong>collecting information via looking at your opponent‚Äôs setup</strong> to determine what your play will be. A few key bits of information that you should look for are:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Next Opponent</strong></td><td>Pokemon Unite shows your upcoming opponent, allowing you to focus on countering one player at a time.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enemy Team Composition</strong></td><td>Analyze what Pokemon they are using and their synergies. Consider if there‚Äôs a way to counter their team.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enemy Unit Placement</strong></td><td>Adjust your Pokemon positioning to counter their layout.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enemy Items</strong></td><td>Observe item distribution and identify who has the Unite Disc (ult).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enemy Abilities</strong></td><td>Check their 2‚òÖ moves to know which abilities they are using.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enemy Bench</strong></td><td>Take note of any benched Pokemon they might move onto the board.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Player Levels in Lobby</strong></td><td>Player levels can be seen next to their names on the left sidebar; useful for gauging experience and risk.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team Compositions in Lobby</strong></td><td>Monitor what comps others are building and how many are contested. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Strength of Enemy Teams</strong></td><td>If a matchup looks unwinnable, consider saving gold. If you're close to winning or need to stabilize, consider spending to power up.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You should aim to always scout your next round opponent each round. It is also advisable to scout the rest of the lobby as often as possible so that you get a general feel of the teams that you will be up against.</p><h2><strong>Positioningüó∫Ô∏è</strong></h2><p>Likewise with scouting, positioning is also one of the most important concepts to learn in autochess games. Unfortunately this is also one of the most complex topics to learn/teach because this mechanic is incredibly complicated. If nothing else, the one thing you should take away from this section is that <strong>Pokemon will always target the nearest opposing Pokemon with their auto-attacks</strong>. </p><p>Improving at positioning your Pokemon comes with lots and lots of gameplay experience. That being said, here are a few general tips on positioning:</p><ul><li>Place melee units at the front and ranged units at the back. </li><li>Move your tankiest Pokemon such that it becomes the primary target by opposing Pokemon. </li><li>If possible, have secondary targets to support your tank by distributing the damage absorbed by your front line.</li><li>Have your damage dealers focus attacks on weaker enemy Pokemon first.</li><li>Contrary to the rule above, have your attacks focus on stronger enemy Pokemon when that Pokemon is a hyper carry for your opponent.</li><li>Avoid clumping Pokemon together when the enemy team has area of effect damage.</li><li>Clump Pokemon together when you can benefit from the effects of area of effect shields and heals. </li><li>Watch for snipers (Inteleon, Mewtwo) and back line divers (Urshifu, Lucario, Greninja) if the opponent has them.</li></ul><h2><strong>Contested Pokemon‚öîÔ∏è</strong></h2><p>When multiple players are trying to <strong>build the same composition</strong>, the Pokemon needed in that comp will become contested. Pokemon purchased from the shop by one player will be removed from the total pool of Pokemon available, which means that Pokemon will become more rare for other players.</p><p>Consequently, multiple players trying to obtain the same Pokemon will make it more difficult for all players to find what they need. Popular Pokemon and comps tend to be contested more often than weaker ones. </p><p>If you find that you are contesting others, you have to decide whether you‚Äôre ok with doing so or if you want to pivot to another comp. Contesting 1 or 2 other players for the same comp is usually ok, but be wary if 3 or more other players in the lobby are also trying to build the same comp.</p><p>Even if you do not need a Pokemon, you can still purchase a Pokemon from the shop to <strong>deny</strong> that Pokemon for others. For example, if you are playing a Psychic composition but see that many other people in the lobby need an Umbreon to hit 2‚òÖ, you can steal that Umbreon from the shop to make life more difficult for your opponents. </p><h2><strong>Sandbagging (Purposely Underperforming/Losing)üí§</strong></h2><p>Sometimes you may prefer to underperform or lose a round. The primary reason for sandbagging is to <strong>maintain a loss streak</strong> but there may be other reasons as well.</p><p>For example, if you are playing grass comp and are much stronger than your current opponent, you might want to intentionally position your units poorly so that more of your units get knocked out.</p><p>Another example of when you may want to underperform is during the late game where one of your opponents is extremely strong and you need more time to match their strength. By purposely sandbagging so that you do not knock out another player, you can extend the game for longer and therefore have more time to build up your composition to face the strongest player.</p><h1><strong><u>3. What to do in Every Phase of the Game</u></strong></h1><h2><strong>Early Game</strong></h2><p>I define early game as somewhere up until about round 9. During this phase of the game, you want to focus on building economy and either setting up the comp you will use for the rest of the game or getting ready to pivot to another comp for late game. HP is not a big consideration right now because damage taken is low. You want to be flexible during the early game if possible and shuffle around your composition depending on what you are finding in the shop.</p><p>After round 1, it is highly recommended to <strong>always pick a 2-cost unit</strong> from the 3 Pokemon options you are given. This is because early game gold is very important to snowball the rest of the game.</p><p>On round 2 (and beyond, but round 2 especially), look for <strong>strong early game synergies</strong> like fairy, fighting, or fire. I almost always level up on round 2 to gain an extra Pokemon slot. The situations where you would not want to level up immediately is if your opponent will always win the battle (e.g., they have fairy synergy and you don‚Äôt), you can get a strong 2‚òÖ Pokemon like Decidueye or Umbreon, or your shop looks something like Fennekin / Fennekin / Scorbunny / Scorbunny which has a strong future setup.</p><ul><li>In the case that you do not level up on round 2, I recommend spending 4 gold to invest in XP once so that when you gain +4 XP after the round, your shop next round will have a higher % chance of 2-cost Pokemon. </li></ul><p>The first item selection on round 3 should prioritize early game strength. As of writing, leftovers is by far the strongest early game item and I always take leftovers if I see it as an option. This is because the effects of leftovers will essentially add another Pokemon to your board in the early game. Moreover, <strong>establishing a tanky front line is more important than having a high damage backline in the early game.</strong> This is because front line units survive a lot longer in early levels compared to the late game. Consequently, tank items are usually preferred over damage items in early stages. Attack speed items are also a good choice for the early game. I recommend avoiding all other items. </p><p>For rounds 3/4/5, it is ideal to build a win or lose streak of 3 heading into round 6 to gain more gold from streak bonuses. This means scouting your opponent on round 3 and deciding on whether you think you can win 3 rounds in a row is highly important.</p><p>On round 6, you should only take an emblem if you are planning to go that route for the vast majority of the game. Emblems are risky in that they only provide a +1 boost for a specific synergy, meaning that your playstyle will become a lot less flexible. Taking strong early game emblems (e.g., Fairy or Fire) to win streak with a plan to pivot in the late game is fine though. </p><p>Rounds 7-9 is when most people will gain their first Unite Disc. This will be a major power spike for everyone, so you need to decide when you need to have ult as well. If you are spending gold to hit level 5, you should either already have a 2‚òÖ Pokemon ready to use ult or are planning to re-roll for a 2‚òÖ until you find one. 2-cost, 2‚òÖ tank Pokemon with ult (Umbreon, Wartortle, Mine) are especially strong during this phase.</p><p>Reaching 30 gold and staying above that threshold is ideal for this phase of the game, but it is perfectly normal (and sometimes necessary) to re-roll if you need a power spike. Just try not to completely ruin your economy by rolling too much and not having enough levels or streak bonuses to compensate for later rounds. </p><p>One more thing to note is that even though you may find 3-cost Pokemon in the shop starting from level 4, sometimes it is not worth buying them early on because they are rather expensive at this stage of the game. </p><h2><strong>Mid Game</strong></h2><p>I define mid game as somewhere around round 10 to 15/16. During this phase of the game, you want to solidify your team composition and stabilize your HP. These rounds are not as structured as early game, so the advice that I provide will be more generic compared to the previous section. </p><p>Again for rounds 9/10/11, you want to build a win/lose streak of at least 3 heading into round 12 if possible for extra gold. Even if you are lose streaking, <strong>aim to have at least 25-30HP coming into round 12.</strong></p><p>You will have an additional opportunity to pivot your team if you find an emblem on round 12. If you do not find the emblem that you need to pivot to a composition (e.g., fighting), it may be time to sell all units of that composition on your bench. </p><p>Also during this phase of the game, you should look to transition power away from tank units to carry units. As more units are placed onto the field, tanks become less valuable. This means picking up more damage items and possibly moving your Unite Disc from a tank Pokemon to a damage-focused Pokemon. For example, if you are playing dark + attack speed, this is usually when you will move ult from Umbreon to Glaceon when you find a 2‚òÖ version of it. </p><p>Any 2‚òÖ 3-cost units are super important at this time because finding them will almost guarantee a win streak for a few rounds. Thus, you will want to deny important 2‚òÖ Pokemon for your opponents if you have extra gold and bench slots available. </p><p>In continuation to the above point, levelling is more important than re-rolling if you are being contested by multiple people. This is because leveling will allow you to find key higher cost Pokemon in the shop before your opponents are able to. </p><p>If at any time you fall to around 12-13HP, you want to immediately invest your gold into reaching the next level (preferably level 7) and re-rolling to build as strong of a team as possible. This will give you a buffer round of 1 more losing round before you are knocked out. </p><h2><strong>Late Game</strong></h2><p>Late game starts at around round 15/16 when players start hitting level 7. <strong>You have 1 goal during this phase of the game, and that is to stay alive.</strong> </p><p>During this phase of the game, HP is the most important resource. If you are currently struggling with HP (less than ~15HP), you should level and/or re-roll immediately. Your main goal will be to stabilize and reach round 18.</p><p>After round 18, you should not have much gold banked up (unless you are far ahead in the lobby). Your focus should now be on carry units only and all of your items/Unite Discs should prioritize them. Win/lose streaks are also no longer important.</p><p>It is important to keep at least 12-13HP after round 18 so that you can survive 1 round against the strongest player in the lobby. For example, if you lose against the strongest player who is level 7 and wins with 4 Pokemon alive, you will take 11HP damage. Surviving this 1 round against an unwinnable opponent will allow you to play a few rounds against weaker opponents and finish higher in the standings. <strong>In summary, spend all of your gold at around 12-13HP instead of waiting for 1 more loss (even if you can survive it).</strong></p><p>As the player count dwindles, any extra resources that you have to spare should focus on denying key 2‚òÖ Pokemon for opposing players. If you are strong, try to target other strong players so that you can play for 1st place. If you are weak, target other weak players so that they get knocked out before you do. </p><h1><strong><u>4. Advanced Tips</u></strong></h1><h2><strong>Strongest Board</strong></h2><p>Unless you know what you are doing, it is generally advisable to always play your strongest board setup possible. Your strongest board not only depends on the Pokemon and items available to you, but also the composition that the opponent is currently using. For example, if your opponent is heavily invested in their snipers that can hit your back line (like Intel or Delphox), you may want to use a tankier melee comp instead. Another example is if your opponent is playing a fighting comp, you should prioritize dealing damage over having a tanky composition so that the enemy does not get a chance to ramp up. </p><p>Identifying your strongest board can be tricky, and I think the best way to improve on this is to learn via watching higher rated players and then practicing on your own. A good way to do this is to try and predict the outcome of each round before it happens and see if your prediction was correct. If not, make notes on what had happened and why the winning team won. </p><h2><strong>Win Conditions</strong></h2><p>Know your win conditions and that of your opponents well ahead of time. This applies on both the micro and macro level:</p><p><strong>Micro</strong> - focuses on individual battles and the ideal setup of each Pokemon for any given round.</p><ul><li>Are your items optimized? Can you swap items around between Pokemon such that items are better placed overall? For example, if you have anti-heal items, you want them targeting opposing healers and tanks that recover HP.</li><li>Does the positioning/moves of your units counter that of your opponents? If the enemy has something like an Urshifu, you will want to have as much CC as possible targeting it.</li></ul><p><strong>Macro</strong> - focuses on general progression of the game and things like economy/power spikes/planning for future rounds.</p><ul><li>What units do you need to improve your composition? If you scout around and see that nobody currently has the unit you need, it may be a good time to roll for that unit. </li><li>Keep in mind that it is not always worth it to level up, especially for level 8. Sometimes you want to roll a bit on the next few rounds rather than to push for levels. </li><li>What long-term units are your opponents going for? If you find something that would be beneficial to a strong enemy later on, it may be worth it to hold on to it. </li></ul><h2><strong>Tempo of the Lobby</strong></h2><p>If you scout around and see that the lobby is frantically spending gold, then you will likely need to spend gold as well to keep up. Alternatively, if the lobby seems greedy and is saving gold for late game, you should too. This is referred to as ‚Äò<strong>tempo</strong>‚Äô, or the pace at which the lobby is playing. </p><p>Some compositions will naturally push for a higher tempo than others. You can use this as an indicator for how you should be playing the game. For example, grass comps will often spend gold to gain levels and fire comps like to re-roll early. Dark+speedy comps focus more on saving up towards the mid-late game as their key pieces are often more expensive (Glaceon, Absol, Tyranitar).</p><p>When you are at a healthier hp, you have more options on what tempo you want to play. In other words, you can decide to spend gold to build a win streak or deal more damage to that one enemy who is 1 Tyranitar away from hitting 2‚òÖ but is also low hp. When you have less hp, however, you cannot afford to be greedy and need to up the pace of strengthening your board to not lose. </p><h2><strong>Playing on a Curve (Key Rounds)</strong></h2><p>Power spikes are not so random. After wild Pokemon rounds, you should take note of any emblems picked up by opposing players. Regular item rounds are less impactful.</p><p>Try to play based on win or lose streaks heading into wild Pokemon rounds. This means that if you lost round 3, you may want to also lose rounds 4 and 5 to have a lose streak of 3 heading into round 6. Round 9 is also an important round because you can build a win or lose streak of 3 heading into round 12. Many players will spend gold to power spike on this round so if it looks like you aren‚Äôt able to beat them and continue your win streak, you may want to save gold and accept a lose streak instead. </p><p>Most players will hit level 7 at around round 15 or 16. This is also when players will spend most of their gold to re-roll if they are at low hp. Level 8 is much harder to reach as it requires an immense 60XP and the difference in power spike may not be worth it. </p><p>Another important round is round 19. <strong>Before round 18, the HP damage formula is the winning user‚Äôs level minus 2 + the # of Pokemon alive</strong> on the board for the winning team. <strong>After round 18, everyone takes 2 more damage</strong>, meaning that players will get knocked out much faster. To illustrate this, here‚Äôs a table:</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Player Level</td><td># of Surviving Pokemon</td><td>Damage Dealt/Taken</td><td>Damage Formula</td></tr><tr><td>Before Round 18</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>Level + Pokemon - 2</td></tr><tr><td>After Round 18</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>Level + Pokemon</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><strong>Meta vs Off-Meta</strong></h2><p>Pokemon and compositions that are meta are meta for a reason. That‚Äôs why it's called the ‚Äú<strong>most effective tactics available</strong>‚Äù. Playing the meta <em>will</em> win you more games on average, but it is also important to consider when to play off-meta.</p><p>For example, if water is the strongest comp in the current meta but 4/8 players in the lobby are going water, then you should look to play something else. In these cases, the 2nd strongest comp in the current meta may actually be the strongest comp if too many people are trying to play the strongest comp.</p><p>You should also try to play what the game gives you and be somewhat flexible instead of going into every game with the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to play the strongest meta comp no matter what happens‚Äù.</p><ul><li>It should be noted that I do not think this mindset of ‚Äúonly playing the strongest meta comp‚Äù is bad. In fact, I think this is a good mindset for learning how to play the game because you can focus on improving other aspects of the game without worrying about the team composition. </li><li>This strategy will also help you gain rating points, especially in a meta where the strongest team comp is much stronger than the rest. However, you will plateau with this strategy and to get to the next level you need to learn flexibility. </li></ul><p>This chess quote does a really good job of summarizing meta vs off-meta:<br>‚ÄúI spent my life learning the rules of chess, now I'm learning how to break them‚Äù</p><p>&gt; because everyone has to first learn the meta to improve at the game but the next step of improvement is learning when to break the meta for an advantage.</p><h2><strong>Playing for Top 4</strong></h2><p>You can‚Äôt win them all. Aiming for 1st place in every game is unrealistic because RNG plays a big factor in autochess games. Sometimes you should aim for top 4 instead so that you do not lose any rating points (assuming you are above 6k elo). This means playing against the weakest players in the lobby and denying them Pokemon that they need or spending all of your gold to win enough rounds to claim at least 4th place. </p><h2><strong>Delayed Item Attachment</strong></h2><p>You can attach items and Unite Discs during battle.</p><p>A few mechanics that result from this is waiting until the battle has started to determine how to best attach items to your Pokemon for that fight. For example:</p><ul><li>Attaching a tank item to your Pokemon currently taking the most damage.</li><li>Waiting 1 second before attaching an Unite Disc to your Umbreon in an Umbreon mirror matchup so that your ult comes out later.</li></ul><p>*Note that you have to be very fast if you are going to delay attaching items to Pokemon because you will not gain their benefits immediately from the start of battle.</p><h1><strong><u>5. How to Play Each Composition</u></strong></h1><h2><strong>[Placeholder]</strong></h2><p>This section will be updated sometime after the new season update.</p><h1><strong><u>Hidden Mechanics</u></strong></h1><p>There are a few hidden mechanics in this game and I will add more as they are discovered:</p><ul><li>On <strong>round 2, keep the shop open</strong> at the end of the round to preview the units in the shop on round 3 before item selection.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Amulet Coin</strong> and <strong>Lucky Egg</strong> will only appear as item drops on round 3.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>% chance for an emblem</strong> to appear <strong>increases</strong> depending on how many rounds you have played with that synergy active. For example, if you play grass every round from 1-5, you will have a higher % chance of finding a grass emblem on round 6. This is why things like Fire x6 or Fighting x6 are much more common than expected.<ul><li>(No, I do not know the exact percentages or formulas for this mechanic).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Gengar‚Äôs sludge bomb</strong> will temporarily prevent Pokemon taking poison damage from the move from using their move or ult. I‚Äôm unsure if this is intended or a bug.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Shop % for Pokemon</strong> is determined after you gain +4XP from the previous round, meaning that if you ended the last round at level 5 with 32/36XP, your next round will calculate shop percentages based on your current level of 6.</li></ul><h1>Closing Thoughts</h1><p>I hope you have a ton of fun playing Pokemon Unite autochess! I really like the game thus far and I am super excited for the (eventual) global release of this game.</p><p>Simply playing the game is the best way to learn/improve, but hopefully this guide will be able to improve your experience with the game. I will try to update this guide periodically with new information and mechanics as they arise.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ask me directly! You can reach me on discord @silentsheepy or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:silentsheeped113@gmail.com">silentsheeped113@gmail.com</a>. </p><h1>FAQs</h1><ul><li>When is this game coming to global?<ul><li>I don‚Äôt know.</li></ul></li><li>What can I do if I‚Äôm just incredibly unlucky?<ul><li>It happens, but it's more important to do the best with what you are given than to complain about what your opponents got.</li></ul></li><li>[Something] happened that I don‚Äôt understand why it happened. Is it a bug? <ul><li>Probably. The game is very buggy (mainly around Pokemon being stuck in place, not attacking/doing anything, ult not charging, etc.).</li></ul></li><li>Do you do coaching?<ul><li>Not primarily, but if you have any questions or want me to quickly review a game of yours I can do it (for free). You can also check out my livestream below to study how I play the game because I usually explain my thoughts and decision-making while streaming. </li></ul></li></ul><h1>Link to my Livestream</h1><p>Check out my stream if you want to learn more about Pokemon Unite autochess and improve at the game!
